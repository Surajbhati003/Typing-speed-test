# Typing Speed Test Application

An interactive typing speed test application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project calculates typing speed, detects errors, and displays performance metrics using Chart.js for graphical visualization.

## Features

- **Dynamic Typing Test**: Offers randomly selected sentences for typing practice.
- **Typing Speed Calculation**: Computes Words Per Minute (WPM) and time taken for each test.
- **Mistake Detection**: Analyzes errors in your typing, providing feedback on mistakes made.
- **Graphical Representation**: Uses Chart.js to visualize typing speed per word over time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with responsive design.

4. View your typing speed, mistakes, and a graph of your speed per word.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **JavaScript** for functionality and logic
- **Chart.js** for graphical representation of typing speed

## Code Overview

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the application.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling rules for the application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for handling typing, calculating speed, mistakes, and displaying charts.

## Customization

You can customize the sentences used in the typing test by modifying the `sentences` array in `script.js`. Feel free to add or remove sentences based on your preference.
